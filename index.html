    <h2><a href="./Public/hobbies.html">Hobbies</a></h2>

    <p>
      If I had to name three things outside of work that I am extreemly
      passionate about I would have to say my family, being outdoors, and
      working on cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am both a husband, and father of two young boys. I am extreemly greatful
      for my line of work and the amount of time I get to spend with my family
      because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also been known to spend quite a bit of my spare time under a
      vehicle. I have quite a knack for automotive repair and have rebuilt over
      a half dozen engines in the last 3 years. Having a son that likes to craw
      underneath a car with me has been a great blessing as I love having the
      oportunity to share my talants with others.
